# ‚ö°Ô∏è Power Platform MCP Labs & Samples

Welcome to Power Platform MCP Labs & Samples.

## üß™ Labs

In the labs section you can find how to work with different MCP Servers. We'll have labs for MCP Servers that are available out of the box in Copilot Studio (like the Dataverse MCP Server), but also a custom MCP Server (like the Jokes MCP Server). 

## ‚ú® Samples

We have a lot of samples available. You can use these samples to work with custom MCP Servers in the Power Platform. 

These MCP Servers are built with multiple MCP SDKs, like for instance:
* TypeScript
* Python
* .NET
