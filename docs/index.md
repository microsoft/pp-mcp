# ‚ö°Ô∏è Power Platform MCP Labs & Samples

Welcome to Power Platform MCP Labs & Samples.

## üß™ Labs

The labs section provides hands-on tutorials and guided exercises to help you learn how to work with Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers in the Power Platform ecosystem. These interactive labs are designed to give you practical experience with both built-in and custom MCP implementations.

### What You'll Learn

- **Built-in MCP Servers**: Learn how to leverage MCP Servers that come pre-configured with Copilot Studio, such as the Dataverse MCP Server for seamless data integration
- **Custom MCP Servers**: Build and deploy your own MCP Servers using our sample implementations like the Jokes MCP Server

### Lab Structure

Each lab includes:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Code samples and templates
- Expected outcomes and validation steps
- Additional resources for further learning

Whether you're new to MCP or looking to expand your integration capabilities, these labs will help you master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of working with MCP Servers in the Power Platform.
