## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

| Prerequisite            | Purpose/Notes                                         | Download Link                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Python 3.8+            | Required to run the MCP server                       | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    |
| Git                    | For cloning the repository                           | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)                |
| Visual Studio Code     | Needed for dev tunnels setup      | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/aitour26-WRK532-building-agents-with-copilot-studio.git
cd aitour26-WRK532-building-agents-with-copilot-studio/src/zava-inventory-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

### 3. API Key Authentication

To enable API key authentication, set the `MCP_API_KEY` environment variable before running the server.

**Important:** Be sure to replace `replace-with-api-key` with your actual API key value. You will use this same API key in Microsoft Copilot Studio to authenticate requests to your MCP server.

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```
$env:MCP_API_KEY = "replace-with-api-key"
python src/server.py
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```
set MCP_API_KEY=replace-with-api-key
python src/server.py
```

### 4. Start the Server

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python src/server.py
```

### 5. Setup a dev tunnel in Visual Studio Code by adding a port forward in the ports section

To expose your MCP server to the internet for Copilot Studio integration, you need to set up a dev tunnel in Visual Studio Code. This allows external services to access your local server securely.

**Steps to set up a dev tunnel and port forward:**

1. Open the Ports view (usually found in the bottom panel or via the Command Palette: `View: Open Ports View`).
1. Find the port your MCP server is running on (default is usually 8000 or 5000).
1. Right-click the port and select "Forward Port".
1. Choose "Dev Tunnel" as the forwarding option.
1. When prompted, set the tunnel visibility to **public** so Copilot Studio can access your server.
1. Copy the generated dev tunnel URL and paste this in the [schema.yaml](./schema.yaml) on the place of `{ replace-with-dev-tunnel-URL }`.

**Note:** Dev tunnels require you to be signed in with a Microsoft account in Visual Studio Code. Make sure you are signed in and have the Dev Tunnels extension installed if prompted.

### 6. Create a custom MCP connector in Microsoft Copilot Studio

To add your MCP server to a Copilot Studio agent, follow these steps:

1. Go to Microsoft Copilot Studio and select your agent.
1. Navigate to the Tools page for your agent.
1. Select "Add a tool" and then "New tool".
1. Choose "Custom connector" (this will open Power Apps).
1. Select "New custom connector" and then "Import OpenAPI file".
1. Select the [schema.yaml](./schema.yaml) file.
1. Complete the import and setup in Power Apps.

For more details, see the official documentation: [Add an existing MCP server to your agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/mcp-add-existing-server-to-agent)

### 7. Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to your agent

To add an existing MCP connector to your agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio, follow these steps:

1. Select Agents in the left navigation.
1. Select your agent from the list.
1. Go to the Tools page for your agent.
1. Select Add a tool.
1. Select Model Context Protocol. A list of MCP connectors is displayed.
1. Select the Zava Inventory MCP from the list.
1. Create the connection by entering the same API key you used in the [API Key Authentication](#3-api-key-authentication) section.
1. When you're done, select Add to agent to proceed.

Once added, the MCP server tools will appear under Tools for your agent.

### 8. Test the MCP server in your agent

After you have added the Zava Inventory MCP connector to your agent, you can publish and test the integration and authenticate as an end user in Copilot Studio.

**How to test and authenticate as an end user in Copilot Studio:**

1. Publish your agent by selecting **Publish** in the top right corner of Copilot Studio.
1. Open the integrated **Test** panel and start a conversation with your agent. For example, enter:

      `Get Stores`
1. If your agent needs to access the MCP connector, Copilot Studio will prompt you to open the connection manager.
1. In the connection manager, connect to the Zava Inventory MCP server by providing the required authentication (such as the API key you used [here](#3-api-key-authentication)).
1. After connecting, return to the Test panel and retry your request.
1. Once authenticated, you will receive the actual list of stores from the Zava Inventory MCP server.

For more details, see the official documentation: [Configure user authentication for actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/configure-enduser-authentication).
